Trello is a great tracking tool for large sophisticated projects with several steps and several collaborators. 
The main idea is that all the actions could be divided into 3 main groups: to do, doing and done -
this is a great way to stay on track and check your priorities. The names of the groups could be different from the named 3,
but all should make sense and fit into the flow. Trello is a great digital tool to follow this logic.
