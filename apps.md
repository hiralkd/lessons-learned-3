I learned that it was a very bad idea to try to write new software. In this era of APPs, hopeful entrepreneurs have all sorts of ideas about new APPs they want to create. The reality is that it is quite complicated to develop APPs and you should absolutely not try and make new software at all costs. 
It is a much better idea to use existing platforms and software to begin developing APPs and new ideas.
