Hacking public spaces is shockingly easy. I was surprised to learn how easy it would be for a hacker to hack into a public wifi system and get personal information from unsuspecting people.
Apparently, it is easy to set up a hotspot that has the exact landing page of starbuck per se, you would name the hotspot the name of the public space, such as starbucks
People logging in to starbucks would just login to a name like starbucks2 which would take them to the fake landing page and they would log in to their accounts with their passwords. You would then be able to capture their passwords and information
You could then use this information to access all sorts of private accounts, including email and banking details.
Most people are absolutelt not aware that this type of hacking is a very real possibility. I often wondered how hackers were able to access personal details and while I am sure there are multiple ways to hack accounts, this was a very illuminating discussion.
