One of the most valuable and practical learnings from this class for me was the three critical questions to ask developers as the final filter prior to hiring them. For each of the following three elements (Version Control System, Unit Testing Tool, and Framework) you ask these questions: 1) What [insert option] do you use? 2) What did you compare it to? 3) Why did you pick it?
The best part is that the answers don’t matter (you don’t even need to understand them!), but rather the fact that they can answer them is what’s important. Genius!
