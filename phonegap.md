I am currently working on my startup which requires building an app. I was completely aware of the phonegap functionality. The budget we have for our startup is fairly low and creating a native app for both iOS and Android would be cost prohibitive. Phonegap gives the functionalty of building a web app and it is very useful for creating prototypes. Phonegap provides the HTML, CSS3 functionalities instead of pulling API's for native apps and makes it easier for to create apps and prototype
